  abstract = {We report a comprehensive review of the published reading studies on retrieval interference in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent and subject-verb dependencies. We also provide a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis of self-paced and eyetracking reading studies. We show that the empirical evidence is only partly consistent with cue-based retrieval as implemented in the ACT-R-based model of sentence processing by Lewis \& Vasishth 2005 (LV05) and that there are important differences between the reviewed dependency types. In non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, there is evidence for inhibitory interference in configurations where the correct dependent fully matches the retrieval cues. This is consistent with the LV05 cue-based retrieval account. By contrast, in subject-verb agreement as well as in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent dependencies, no evidence for interference is found in configurations with a fully cue-matching subject. In configurations with only a partially cue-matching subject or antecedent, the meta-analysis revealed facilitatory interference in subject-verb agreement and inhibitory interference in reflexives/reciprocals. The former is consistent with the LV05 account, but the latter is not. Moreover, the meta-analysis revealed that  (i) interference type (proactive versus retroactive) leads to different effects in the reviewed dependency types; and (ii) the prominence of the distractor has an important impact on the interference effect. In sum, the meta-analysis suggests that the LV05 needs important modifications to account for (i) the unexplained interference patterns and (ii) the differences between the dependency types. More generally, the meta-analysis provides a quantitative empirical basis for comparing the predictions of competing accounts of retrieval processes in sentence comprehension.},

We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

Recently, several self-paced reading studies have presented surprising evidence that object relatives in Chinese are easier to process than subject relatives. We carried out three self-paced reading experiments that attempted to replicate these results. Two of our three studies found a subject-relative preference, and the third study found an object-relative advantage. Using a random effects bayesian meta-analysis of fifteen studies (including our own), we show that the overall current evidence for the subject-relative advantage is quite strong (approximate posterior probability of a subject-relative advantage given the data: 78–80\%). We argue that retrieval/integration based accounts would have difficulty explaining all three experimental results. These findings are important because they narrow the theoretical space by limiting the role of an important class of explanation—retrieval/integration cost—at least for relative clause processing in Chinese.},

  abstract = {Reading times on words in a sentence depend on the amount of information the words convey, which can be estimated by probabilistic language models. We investigate whether event-related potentials (ERPs), too, are predicted by information measures. Three types of language models estimated four different information measures on each word of a sample of English sentences. Six different ERP deflections were extracted from the EEG signal of participants reading the same sentences. A comparison between the information measures and ERPs revealed a reliable correlation between N400 amplitude and word surprisal. Language models that make no use of syntactic structure fitted the data better than did a phrase-structure grammar, which did not account for unique variance in N400 amplitude. These findings suggest that different information measures quantify cognitively different processes and that readers do not make use of a sentence’s hierarchical structure for generating expectations about the upcoming word.

The e.r.ps triggered by verbal stimuli have been related to several different aspects of language processing1. For example, the N400 component, peaking around 400 ms post-stimulus, appears to be a sensitive indicator of the semantic relationship between a word and the context in which it occurs. Words that complete sentences in a nonsensical fashion elicit much larger N400 waves than do semantically appropriate words or non-semantic irregularities in a text2,3. In the present study, e.r.ps were recorded in response to words that completed meaningful sentences. The amplitude of the N400 component of the e.r.p. was found to be an inverse function of the subject's expectancy for the terminal word as measured by its ‘Cloze probability’. In addition, unexpected words that were semantically related to highly expected words elicited lower N400 amplitudes. These findings suggest N400 may reflect processes of semantic priming or activation.},

In our direct replication study spanning 9 laboratories (N=334), pre-registered replication-analyses and exploratory Bayes Factor analyses successfully replicated the noun-results but, crucially, not the article-results. Pre-registered single-trial analyses also yielded a statistically significant effect for the nouns but not the articles. Exploratory Bayesian single-trial analyses showed that the article-effect may be non-zero but is likely far smaller than originally reported and too small to observe without very large sample sizes. Our results do not support the view that readers routinely pre-activate the phonological form of predictable words.},

  abstract = {In explicit memory recall and recognition tasks, elaboration and contextual isolation both facilitate memory performance. Here, we investigate these effects in the context of sentence processing: targets for retrieval during online sentence processing of English object relative clause constructions differ in the amount of elaboration associated with the target noun phrase, or the homogeneity of superficial features (text color). Experiment 1 shows that greater elaboration for targets during the encoding phase reduces reading times at retrieval sites, but elaboration of non-targets has considerably weaker effects. Experiment 2 illustrates that processing isolated superficial features of target noun phrases—here, a green word in a sentence with words colored white—does not lead to enhanced memory performance, despite triggering longer encoding times. These results are interpreted in the light of the memory models of Nairne, 1990, 2001, 2006, which state that encoding remnants contribute to the set of retrieval cues that provide the basis for similarity-based interference effects.},

  abstract = {Expectation-driven facilitation (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and locality-driven retrieval difficulty (Gibson, 1998, 2000; Lewis &
Vasishth, 2005) are widely recognized to be two critical factors in incremental sentence processing; there is accumulating
evidence that both can influence processing difficulty. However, it is unclear whether and how expectations and memory
interact. We first confirm a key prediction of the expectation account: a Hindi self-paced reading study shows that when an
expectation for an upcoming part of speech is dashed, building a rarer structure consumes more processing time than
building a less rare structure. This is a strong validation of the expectation-based account. In a second study, we show that
when expectation is strong, i.e., when a particular verb is predicted, strong facilitation effects are seen when the appearance
of the verb is delayed; however, when expectation is weak, i.e., when only the part of speech ``verb'' is predicted but a
particular verb is not predicted, the facilitation disappears and a tendency towards a locality effect is seen. The interaction
seen between expectation strength and distance shows that strong expectations cancel locality effects, and that weak
expectations allow locality effects to emerge.},

  ABSTRACT={We examined the effects of argument-head distance in SVO and SOV languages (Spanish and German), while taking into account readers’ working memory capacity and controlling for expectation (Levy, 2008) and other factors. We predicted only locality effects, that is, a slow-down produced by increased dependency distance (Gibson, 2000; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005). Furthermore, we expected stronger locality effects for readers with low working memory capacity. Contrary to our predictions, low-capacity readers showed faster reading with increased distance, while high-capacity readers showed locality effects. We suggest that while the locality effects are compatible with memory-based explanations, the speedup of low-capacity readers can be explained by an increased probability of retrieval failure. We present a computational model based on ACT-R built under the previous assumptions, which is able to give a qualitative account for the present data and can be tested in future research. Our results suggest that in some cases, interpreting longer RTs as indexing increased processing difficulty and shorter RTs as facilitation may be too simplistic: The same increase in processing difficulty may lead to slowdowns in high-capacity readers and speedups in low-capacity ones. Ignoring individual level capacity differences when investigating locality effects may lead to misleading conclusions.}

  control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application
  of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence
  parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative
  memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive
  principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R)
  architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R.We present the results of 6 sets of simulations:
  5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on
  both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of
  double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-
  embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model‚Äôs complete reliance on discriminating
  retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained
  with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R
  defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference
  are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory
  and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

We present a model of cue-based retrieval in sentence processing that formalizes (i) memory accessibility (prominence) and (ii) a theory of associative cues as extensions to the ACT-R model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005). The extensions are independently motivated and, compared to the original model, enable more differentiated predictions with respect to the experimental design of individual experiments as well as differences between retrieval contexts. The predictions of the original and the extended model are compared with the results of a comprehensive Bayesian meta-analysis of published studies on retrieval interference in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent and subject-verb dependencies (Jäger, Engelmann, Vasishth, submitted). Quantitative simulations show that the extended model accounts for effects that are outside the scope of the original model. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for different aspects of memory accessibility, for individual study design, and context-based feature-selectivity in order to generate accurate predictions of a model of cue-based memory retrieval. The simulation results thus shed new light on the cognitive mechanisms un- derlying interference effects and should be considered in the interpretation of the available data and in the design of future experiments.},

However, studies relating changes in attentional load and task experience on a finer scale to pupil size modulations are scarce. Here, we investigated how these changes affect pupil sizes. To manipulate attentional load, participants covertly tracked between zero and five objects among several randomly moving objects on a computer screen. To investigate effects of task experience, the experiment was conducted on three consecutive days. We found that pupil sizes increased with each increment in attentional load. Across days, we found systematic pupil size reductions. We compared the model fit for predicting pupil size modulations using attentional load, task experience, and task performance as predictors. We found that a model which included attentional load and task experience as predictors had the best model fit while adding performance as a predictor to this model reduced the overall model fit. Overall, results suggest that pupillometry provides a viable metric for precisely assessing attentional load and task experience in visuospatial tasks.},

  abstract = {Pupil size is correlated with a wide variety of important cognitive variables and is increasingly being used by cognitive scientists. Pupil data can be recorded inexpensively and non-invasively by many commonly used video-based eye-tracking cameras. Despite the relative ease of data collection and increasing prevalence of pupil data in the cognitive literature, researchers often underestimate the methodological challenges associated with controlling for confounds that can result in misinterpretation of their data. One serious confound that is often not properly controlled is pupil foreshortening error (PFE)—the foreshortening of the pupil image as the eye rotates away from the camera. Here we systematically map PFE using an artificial eye model and then apply a geometric model correction. Three artificial eyes with different fixed pupil sizes were used to systematically measure changes in pupil size as a function of gaze position with a desktop EyeLink 1000 tracker. A grid-based map of pupil measurements was recorded with each artificial eye across three experimental layouts of the eye-tracking camera and display. Large, systematic deviations in pupil size were observed across all nine maps. The measured PFE was corrected by a geometric model that expressed the foreshortening of the pupil area as a function of the cosine of the angle between the eye-to-camera axis and the eye-to-stimulus axis. The model reduced the root mean squared error of pupil measurements by 82.5 \% when the model parameters were pre-set to the physical layout dimensions, and by 97.5 \% when they were optimized to fit the empirical error surface.},

Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 9, 278–291), adequately captures the shape of empirical RT distributions. We first derive closed-form analytic solutions for the mean and variance of a diffusion model RT distribution. Next, we study how systematic differences in two important diffusion model parameters simultaneously affect the mean and the variance of the diffusion model RT distribution. Within the range of plausible values for the drift rate parameter, the relation between RT mean and RT standard deviation is approximately linear. Manipulation of the boundary separation parameter also leads to an approximately linear relation between RT mean and RT standard deviation, but only for low values of the drift rate parameter.},

ABSTRACT={Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a complex task recruiting a distributed network of brain regions. There are also marked individual differences in MOT performance. A positive causal relationship between the anterior intraparietal sulcus (AIPS), an integral region in the MOT attention network and inter-individual variation in MOT performance has not been previously established. The present study used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, in order to examine such a causal link. Active anodal stimulation was applied to the right AIPS and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (and sham stimulation), an area associated with working memory (but not MOT) while participants completed a MOT task. Stimulation to the right AIPS significantly improved MOT accuracy more than the other two conditions. The results confirm a causal role of the AIPS in the MOT task and illustrate that tDCS has the ability to improve MOT performance.}
